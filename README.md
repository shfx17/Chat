# Chat
Simple Chat in jQuery + PHP7.
Users can post via chat in real time (asynchronous connection). The real time is saved and sent to the database. Then it appears on the right side of the user's message.

How to start ?

1. Create table in database, e.g: MySQL. (look at the file -> sql/db.sql).
2. Open file <b>chat.php</b> and set connection to your database.
3. Open file <b>js/chat.js</b> and in 3 lines you have to set your path to the file.
4. Congratulations! You can use this script.
